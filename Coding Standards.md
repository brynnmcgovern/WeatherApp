# Naming Conventions:
## Variables and Functions:

Use meaningful and descriptive names.
Follow camelCase for variables and functions (e.g., fetchWeatherData, kelvinToFahrenheit).

## Constants:

Use uppercase letters with underscores for constants (e.g., API_KEY).

## Components:

Component names should be in PascalCase (e.g., Weather, Horoscope).

# Formatting:
## Indentation:

Use 2 or 4 spaces for indentation. Be consistent throughout the codebase.

## Braces:

Always use braces, even for one-line blocks.

## Line Length:

Limit lines to 80-120 characters for better readability.

# Comments:
## Inline Comments:

Use inline comments sparingly, explaining complex logic or tricky parts.

## Function/Component Comments:

Provide comments for functions and components, describing their purpose and parameters.

# Error Handling:
## Use Try-Catch:

Wrap API calls or potential error-prone code with try-catch blocks.

## Error Messages:

Provide clear and informative error messages when handling errors.

# React Best Practices:
## Functional Components:

Use functional components with hooks when possible.

## State Management:

Use state management libraries like Redux for complex state requirements.

## Destructuring:

Destructure objects and arrays in function parameters or when extracting values.

# API Requests:
## API Key Handling:

Store API keys securely, and avoid hardcoding them directly in the code.

## Async/Await:

Use async/await syntax for cleaner asynchronous code.

# Consistency:
## Be Consistent:
Maintain a consistent coding style across the entire project.
